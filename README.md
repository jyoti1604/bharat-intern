This  repository contains three machine learning projects focused on different aspects of predictive modeling. Each project is implemented using linear regression and logistic regression  and includes Jupyter notebook code for easy understanding and reproduction.

House Price Prediction:
    In this project, a machine learning model is developed to predict house prices. By utilizing linear regression techniques, the model analyzes various features of houses and learns patterns to estimate their prices accurately. The Jupyter notebook code provides detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions on how to train and evaluate the model.

Wine Quality Prediction:
    The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to determine the quality of wines based on specific attributes using linear regression. By training a machine learning model on a dataset comprising various wine characteristics, the model can predict the quality rating of a given wine sample. The Jupyter notebook code offers insights into the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages.


All two projects are designed to demonstrate the application of  regression in specific domains, showcasing how it can be used effectively for prediction tasks. By exploring the provided Jupyter notebook code, users can gain a deeper understanding of the implementation details and potentially apply similar techniques to their own projects.
